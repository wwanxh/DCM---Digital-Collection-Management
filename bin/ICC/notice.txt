Document Conersion Patterns Supported:
A : TIFF -> 3 versions -> PDF/A 3B with Raws Moving (Lossless, lossy 50 30) 
A1: TIFF -> 3 versions -> PDF/A 3B with Raws Copying (Lossless, lossy 50 30) 
A2: TIFF -> 3 versions -> PDF/A 3B with Raws Remaining (Lossless, lossy 50 30) 
B1: TIFF -> PDF/A 3B with RAWs Moving
B2: TIFF -> PDF/A 3B with RAWs Copying
B3: TIFF -> PDF/A 3B only
	*(Customized Quality Loss Level of Compression) //100-lossless, not linear for 0-99
C1: PDF/A 3B -> JP2 -> TIFF (JP2 RETAINED)
C2: PDF/A 3B -> TIFF (JP2 NOT RETAINED)

v2.0 - 09/15/2017
 -New Iteration
	- Performance Improved
	- Modes reconstructed (Please see description above)
		-Mode A, A1, A2, B1, B2, B3, C1, C2
	- Notes Embeded
		-If a note found with a document, then the note will be embeded into root metadata
			of the document PDF file
	- Code sturcture optimized
	- Integrated Directory_Name_Trimmer (correct folder's illegal name before proessing) and 
		Directory_Files_Trimmer (remove all trash file after completion) into main program
	- Bugs handled
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.5 & v1.6 - 07/26/2017
 - Invalid or unsupported files will be skipped!
	- A txt file containning all error files will be automatically created if needed.
 - Process flow path has been changed!
	- Each tiff file will be converted to 4 versions (Lossless, compression level 30, 40, 50) at the same time. It helps to improve performance in processing some folders with only containing less 10 files.

V1.3 - 07/19/2017
 - Whitespaces in Filename Bug Handled!
	- Folder Analyzer right now can detect and remove all whitespaces existing in each filename if necessary.
	  The filename which contains whitespaces will be renamed before conversions. 

V1.2 - 06/07/2017
 - Bugs Fixed!

V1.1 - 06/01/2017
 - 2 New TIFFs to PDF/A-2B Conversion Mode Added
	- Moving TIFFs and other log files from source directory to target directory
	- Copying TIFFs and other log files from source directory to target directory
 - Compression Level Can be chosen now!
	- Supporting Lossless or Loss Conversion (New Field added into GUI to indicate the level of compression)
	- Notice for Choosing a Compression Level:
		For the JPEG-2000 image format, quality is mapped using a non-linear equation to the compression 
		ratio required by the Jasper library. This non-linear equation is intended to loosely approximate 
		the quality provided by the JPEG v1 format. The default quality value 100, a request for non-lossy 
		compression. A quality of 75 results in a request for 16:1 compression.
		
 - Performance Improved!
	- Multi-Threads Supporting
	- Almost 5 times faster than previous version
 - Bugs Fixed!
